Abstract (done)

---
Intro
-main observation
-my conjecture
-why important
-AAA disappearance is robust
-describe model
-discuss results
-increasing dispersion

---
Lit Review?

---
Credit Rating Agency Details

---
Model
-environment/overview
-ratings functions and signal, discuss functional form
-firms/investors
-equilibrium
-mechanism
-decreasing pi prop
-decreasing A prop
-implication: increasing spread
-implication: switching between classes

---
Data: decrease in Hi IG
-COMPUSTAT
-show leverage ratio changes
-firms aren't merging

---
Data: increasing spread
-Mergent FISD
-process: why bins, why spread over treasury, fixed coupon, closest to offering, which bonds?
-standard deviation increases, so is mean
-use coefficient of variation means I can test for stat sig.

---
Conclusion
-AAA disappearance consistent with story
-implications
-consistent with new data
-must consider this for recent policy changes

---
Appendix
-confidence intervals for CoV
-any algebra
